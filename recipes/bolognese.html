        These Bolognese Stuffed Peppers are an ideal weeknight meal. 
        Quick, easy, minimal clean up, and completely delicious and 
        satisfying.

        Bell peppers are filled with a simple bolognese 
        sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, and a sprinkling of 
        panko for crunch! They taste like a bowl of pasta in veggie 
        form!

        <li>⅛ cup celery</li>
        <li>6 bell peppers (any color) stems and seeds removed, 
            cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>

        <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Stir in the carrots and celery; cook and stir until the 
            vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in ground beef and pancetta, and cook until browned and 
            crumbled; drain off any excess liquid, and return to heat. 
            Add marinara sauce, wine, and red pepper flakes, 
            and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in cream, half of the Parmesan cheese, 
            and rice. Simmer 5 minutes more, or until most liquid has absorbed.</li>
        <li>Place peppers in a shallow baking dish, and fill with beef mixture. 
            Drizzle with remaining olive oil and top with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve hot.</li>
